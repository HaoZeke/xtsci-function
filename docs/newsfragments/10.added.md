# Release Notes: Caching Mechanism in ObjectiveFunction

## Introduction
A caching mechanism has been implemented in the `ObjectiveFunction` class. Enhances computational efficiency by avoiding redundant calculations for function evaluations, gradients, and Hessians.

## Features
- **Caching Functionality:** The caching mechanism stores the results of function evaluations, gradients, and Hessians. When the same input `x` is used in subsequent calls, the cached results are returned instead of recalculating.
- **Counter Management:** The class includes counters for function evaluations, gradient evaluations, Hessian evaluations, and a unique computation counter (`unique_func_grad_hess`). These counters are updated based on whether a new calculation is performed or a cached result is used.
- **Cache Invalidation:** The cache is invalidated automatically when a new input `x` is provided, ensuring that the most recent data is used for calculations.

## Implementation
- The caching is integrated within the `operator()`, `gradient`, and `hessian` methods.
- A boolean flag, `m_isCacheValid`, is used to track the validity of the cache. It is set after each computation and reset when the input changes.
- Cached values are stored in `m_lastFunctionValue`, `m_lastGradient`, and `m_lastHessian`.
- The `unique_func_grad_hess` counter is incremented only for new computations, accurately reflecting the number of unique computations performed.

## Assumptions and Considerations
- **Input Stability:** The caching assumes that the input `x` remains consistent between calls for the cache to be valid.
- **Floating-Point Precision:** The comparison of `x` with the last input uses `xt::allclose` to handle potential floating-point precision issues, which could otherwise lead to cache invalidation.

## Impact and Usage
- **Performance Improvement:** This mechanism improves performance in scenarios where the same input `x` is frequently used for multiple evaluations.
- **Calculation Accuracy:** By ensuring up-to-date calculations and effective cache invalidation, the implementation maintains the accuracy of computations.
