* About ~xtsci-function~

A repository with a function base class for ease of exploration, with optimizers
and saddle search methods. The repository also includes standard test functions
from statistics and chemistry.

Trial functions implemented:
- Rosenbrock function
- Himmelblau's function

** Usage
Until bindings are ready, ~tiny_cli.cpp~ can be edited and run with output piped
to get a visual for the trial functions.

#+begin_src bash
meson setup bbdir
meson compile -C bbdir
./bbdir/CppCore/tiny_cli > output.txt
#+end_src

** Components
The heart of the library is the ~xts::func~ namespace.

- Note that this uses designated initializers, a C++20 feature.

** Provenance
References are provided, but these were originally conceived for use with [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/xtsci-optimize][xtsci-optimize]].
